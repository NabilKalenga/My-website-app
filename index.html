        <p>Hey everyone! I wanted to share a little bit about how my passion for software development and computer technology began. It all started when I was just a baby. My parents had a computer at home and I was always fascinated by the keyboard. I would sit on the couch and try to type, even before I could properly walk! As I grew older, I became more curious about how computers worked and started exploring different programs and games. I remember spending countless hours tinkering with software, trying to figure out how things were built and how they could be improved. This early exposure sparked my interest in coding and website design. I started learning HTML, JavaScript, and CSS with the help of my Uncle, and the more I learned, the more I fell in love with the endless possibilities of technology, Now, I’m excited to continue my journey in software development and share my passion with others. It’s amazing how a simple curiosity as a baby led me to where I am today. I can’t wait to see what the future holds!</p>
        <br>
